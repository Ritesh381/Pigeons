        <h3 class="red">“Your morning cup of coffee has a carbon footprint of 50 grams – drink
            two, and you’ve emitted as much as driving a kilometer!”</h3>
        <p>Energy consumption at home is directly tied to carbon emissions because much of our energy comes
            from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. These fuels release CO₂, a major contributor to
            climate change. For example, every time we use electricity from a coal -powered grid, cook with LPG, or
            drive fuel-powered vehicles, we add to our carbon footprint. Simpl e actions, like switching to energy-
            efficient appliances or renewable energy, can cut down emissions significantly, helping us protect the
            planet while saving on energy costs.</p>

        <h3 class="red">"Ironing your clothes for just 10 minutes emits around 200 grams of CO₂"</h3>
        <p>Impact of Household Appliances and Transportation:</p>
           <ol>
            <li>CO₂ from Cooking with LPG:
                <ul>
                    <li>LPG emits approximately 2.9 kg of CO₂ per liter burned.</li>
                    <li>For a household using 10 liters of LPG per month, this translates to 10 liters times 2.9 kg = 29 kg of CO₂ per month</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Fuels for Transportation and Carbon Emissions
                <ul>
                    <li>Petrol/Diesel Vehicles:</li>
                    <li>A car emitting 2.3 kg of CO₂ per liter of petrol consumed could quickly add several tons<br>
                        of CO₂ annually for a family.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <img src="co2-by-source.png" width="700px" height="500px"/>
        <p>Upon interpreting the above graph, it can be concluded that:</p>
        <h3 class="red">"Every second, 1,330 tons of CO2 is being emitted!"</h3>
        <h3 class="red">"Emitting 10,000 tons of CO2 in the time it takes to say a single sentence."</h3>
